# Monitoring-school-safety
School Safety are the measures undertaken by the learners, staff, parents and other stakeholders to either minimize or eliminate risky conditions or threats that may cause accidents, bodily injury as well as emotional and psychological distress. Accidents can lead to disability or death while emotional and psychological trauma can result in lack of self-esteem and ultimately lead to poor performance of tasks and responsibilities. Creating a School Safe Zones does not only mean ensuring an accident free school environment. Rather, it is the responsibility taken by learners, staff, parents and stakeholders to foster all-round safe living. The school management system offers a feature for efficient visitor management. It allows the security to keep a detailed record of all the visitors arriving and leaving the school premises.



THINGS WE IMPLEMENTED - STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE


STEP 1)  STUDENT INFORMATION PORTAL: The SIP is the hub for all your personal student information: the courses you are registered in, your grades, your financial statements, your scholarship application, and much more.



STEP 2)   ATTENDANCE LACKAGE REMINDER: This free extension serves as your gentle reminder to take attendance! It's easy to get wrapped up in the happenings of the school day, and no one wants to get an email from the front office.



STEP 3)   SECURED FEES PAYMENT ANALYSIS: A secured credit card is a type of credit card that is backed by a cash deposit from the cardholder. This deposit acts as collateral on the account, providing the card issuer with security in case the cardholder can't make payments.



STEP 4)  STUDENT VIOLATION SYSTEM: The SIP is the hub for all your personal student information: the courses you are registered in, your grades, your financial statements, your scholarship application, and much more.



STEP 5)  COMPLAINT REGISTRATION: If you file a complaint with the school, the principal is required by law to investigate and fix the problem. Your school, including teachers and administrators, is required by law to protect you and must take the necessary steps to stop any form of bullying.



STEP 6)  PARENT-TEACHERS PORTAL: Parents-Teacher portal is an opportunity for parents and teachers to discuss what's happening at school and at home. Ideally, an open and honest dialogue between parent and teacher can affect change for the better in your child's life.
